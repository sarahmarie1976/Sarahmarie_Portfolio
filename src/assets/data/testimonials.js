      "I worked with Sarahmarie when I was a team lead for a cohort she was in. The quality that I immediately noticed about her is her leadership. Part of being a great leader is being a great communicator. If she's not certain about something, she'll reach out. As great of an engineer, as she is, she's always open to admit if she's having difficulties with some things which makes working with her a lot easier as you won't have any of those bad kinds of surprises... I know she's ready to contribute to any team immediately and with her potential and eagerness to grow, I honestly believe the sky's the limit for her.",

      'Sarahmarie and I worked together during my Unit 3 Build Week at Lambda School. She was in Unit 4 during that time, and was assigned to create the backend API of our project. She was very good in presenting the API endpoints to meet the requirements of the product. Every project will always have some hiccups, and even when the team experienced technical problems, Sarahmarie helped the team move forward with her passion and grit working towards the teams project deliverables, especially documenting every work her and her Unit 4 teammate has done . I highly recommend Sarahmarie for any team that values hard working developers, and would love the opportunity to work with her again!',

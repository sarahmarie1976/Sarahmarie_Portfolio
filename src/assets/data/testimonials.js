      "I worked with Sarahmarie when I was a team lead for a cohort she was in. The quality that I immediately noticed about her is her leadership. Part of being a great leader is being a great communicator. If she's not certain about something, she'll reach out. As great of an engineer, as she is, she's always open to admit if she's having difficulties with some things which makes working with her a lot easier as you won't have any of those bad kinds of surprises.She also shows this eagerness to improve and expand on what she already knows. Although we're not taught about UX designs, she willingly volunteered to do the designing for her team being mentored by someone from Lambda. With the amount of time they were given to complete this project, I think that shows someone's willingness to improve and help their team out. While others would be scared of doing something you haven't done before, Sarahmarie sees opportunities for growth. And so with that, it's not hard to see how having someone as great as Sarahmarie, as a person and engineer, will help any company that she might end up working for. I know she's ready to contribute to any team immediately and with her potential and eagerness to grow, I honestly believe the sky's the limit for her.",
